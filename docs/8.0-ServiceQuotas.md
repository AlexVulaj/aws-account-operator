## Where are Service Quotas defined?
AAO now supports multiple account pools, any of which can be defined to have a specific set of AWS Service Quotas on a per Region Basis. Given we only request service quota changes for Accounts in an AccountPool, Service Quotas requests are currently only for non-CCS Accounts. These service quotas are set in the AAO ConfigMap under the accountpool key, example:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: aws-account-operator-configmap
  namespace: aws-account-operator
data:
  account-limit: "1234"
  accountpool: |
    hivei01ue1:
      default: true
    fm-accountpool:
      servicequotas:
        default:
          L-1216C47A: '750'
          L-0EA8095F: '200'
          L-69A177A2: '255'
          L-0263D0A3: '6'
        us-east-1:
          L-1216C47A: '760'
```
## How are Service Quotas applied to an AccountPool?
In the above example, the `default` `AccountPool` is unaffected by service quota requests, whereas each account created in the `fm-accountpool` will have the default set of service quotas applied to *all* regions supported by it. For us-east-1 specifically, it will set `L-1216C47A` to 760. Accounts created in the `fm-accountpool` will have the `servicequotas` struct we see in the ConfigMap added directly into the Account CR spec - [here is a link to the code where that happens](https://github.com/openshift/aws-account-operator/blob/7eaa90bb66060cc046a4e37e4f3052ed8a234395/controllers/accountpool/accountpool_controller.go#L117-L170).

Here is a simplified example of what the newly created AccountCR will look like at this point:
```yaml
kind: Account
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: "2023-03-21T18:11:04Z"
  finalizers:
  - finalizer.aws.managed.openshift.io
  name: osd-creds-mgmt-lsw9hb
  namespace: aws-account-operator
  ownerReferences:
  - apiVersion: aws.managed.openshift.io/v1alpha1
    blockOwnerDeletion: true
    controller: true
    kind: AccountPool
    name: fm-accountpool
spec:
  accountPool: fm-accountpool
  awsAccountID: ""
  regionalServiceQuotas:
    default:
      L-0263D0A3:
        value: 6
      L-0EA8095F:
        value: 200
      L-69A177A2:
        value: 255
      L-1216C47A:
        value: 750
    us-east-1:
      L-1216C47A: 760
```

## So our new Account has service quotas defined, now what?
Our new `Account` CR should reconcile as normal, once it reaches the `PendingVerification` State, that is when we make the Service Quota requests. `PendingVerification` encapsulates 2 sets of requests to AWS:
1. Creating a Support Case with AWS to enable Enterprise Support.
2. Make any Service Quota requests as defined in the AccountCR spec.regionalServiceQuotas   

To track the state of our service quota requests between reconciles, we load the service quotas in the Account CR spec into the Account CR status. To make life a bit easier tracking state, we build out each region in the `.status.regionalServiceQuotas` and keep a `status` field too, [link to code](https://github.com/openshift/aws-account-operator/blob/7eaa90bb66060cc046a4e37e4f3052ed8a234395/controllers/account/account_controller.go#L636-L697) and example:
```yaml
status:
  regionalServiceQuotas:
    ap-northeast-1:
      L-0263D0A3:
        status: COMPLETED
        value: 6
      L-0EA8095F:
        status: IN_PROGRESS
        value: 200
      L-69A177A2:
        status: COMPLETED
        value: 255
      L-1216C47A:
        status: COMPLETED
        value: 750
    ap-northeast-2:
      L-0EA8095F:
        status: TODO
        value: 200
      L-69A177A2:
        status: TODO
        value: 255
      L-0263D0A3:
        status: TODO
        value: 6
      L-1216C47A:
        status: TODO
        value: 750
```

## How to update service quotas for AccountPool owned accounts?
Begin by updating the AAO ConfigMap and then restarting the `aws-account-operator` pod. Upon the update, the `accountpool_validation_controller.go` will parse the modified AAO ConfigMap using the `GetServiceQuotasFromAccountPool` function: [https://github.com/openshift/aws-account-operator/blob/4af362e874f99454c7b69166588c4536728bbfc5/pkg/utils/utils.go#L116-L165]

Subsequently, within the `accountpool_validation_controller.go`, all accounts associated with an accountpool will be iterated over. It will inspect the `account.Spec.RegionalServiceQuotas` for any discrepancies compared to the ConfigMap, updating the spec accordingly: [https://github.com/openshift/aws-account-operator/blob/91d7d76294ebd2d9e6da512b0ed2fd7d7cf759b2/controllers/validation/accountpool_validation_controller.go#L126-L182]

The updated account spec will then trigger the `account_validation_controller.go`, where the handling of service quota requests will occur [link to code](https://github.com/openshift/aws-account-operator/blob/91d7d76294ebd2d9e6da512b0ed2fd7d7cf759b2/controllers/validation/account_validation_controller.go#L457-L530)

## How to add support for additional service quotas?
#### Step 1: Define Service and Quota Codes
In `account_types.go` you add the quota code if it's not already supported. Below is a list of supported service quotas with their respective codes: [https://github.com/openshift/aws-account-operator/blob/d0c927b56353a0a754253e8b950848315ef595b0/api/v1alpha1/account_types.go#L67-L74]. Additionally, in the same file, you must also define the service code for the supported service quota services: [https://github.com/openshift/aws-account-operator/blob/d0c927b56353a0a754253e8b950848315ef595b0/api/v1alpha1/account_types.go#L78-L82].
#### Step 2: Update Supported Service Map
In the `getServiceCode` function, extend the servicesMap by adding additional mappings for the new quota codes you've introduced. Ensure that each quotaCode is associated with the correct service code, enabling the function to provide accurate service code lookups for the supported service quotas: [https://github.com/openshift/aws-account-operator/blob/d0c927b56353a0a754253e8b950848315ef595b0/controllers/account/service_quota.go#L96-L106].

## Batch, batch, batch
AWS has a maximum limit of 20 Service Quota requests in flight per account at a given time, if you surpass this threshold there is a chance they will blanket deny all in-flight and subsequent requests, which forces us to put the account into a failed state. So avoid this, we batch our requests and apply a limit of 20 in-flight requests - [link to code](https://github.com/openshift/aws-account-operator/blob/7eaa90bb66060cc046a4e37e4f3052ed8a234395/controllers/account/account_controller.go#L549-L581). To aid in quickly getting the different service quotas by their current state, we wrote (this helper function)[https://github.com/openshift/aws-account-operator/blob/7eaa90bb66060cc046a4e37e4f3052ed8a234395/api/v1alpha1/account_types.go#L228-L249]. Once we have our batch of service quotas to request, we need to assume role into the correct region and make the request to AWS. All of the logic around the actual Service Quota request is handled (here in the HandleServiceQuotaRequests function)[https://github.com/openshift/aws-account-operator/blob/7eaa90bb66060cc046a4e37e4f3052ed8a234395/controllers/account/service_quota.go#L19-L91]. In `HandleServiceQuotaRequests`, we first determine if the service quota request is even needed, if not, we don't want to overload AWS. If it is needed, we check to see if we've already requested this service quota in the past, depending on what AWS returns [we update accordingly](https://github.com/openshift/aws-account-operator/blob/7eaa90bb66060cc046a4e37e4f3052ed8a234395/controllers/account/service_quota.go#L49-L81).

Once all Service Quotas have moved into a `COMPLETED` state, it is only then we will finally set the Account CR to a `Ready` state.
